> **Specialized automated extraction from three different invoice types of Supplier X using Power Automate Desktop.**

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project automates the extraction of structured data from batches of **prepayment** and **regular** invoices issued by **Supplier X**.

Two custom-designed **Power Automate Desktop (PAD)** workflows were developed:

- **Prepayment Invoice Flow** ‚Äì tailored for advance payment invoices
- **Regular Invoice Flow** ‚Äì tailored for consumption and billing invoices

Both flows extract key fields from PDF invoices and compile them into structured Excel files.

## üéØ Why This Automation Matters

Manually processing invoices is:
- Time-consuming
- Prone to data entry errors
- Inefficient for scaling

By **tailoring the automation** to the supplier's invoice variations, this solution saves:
- Up to **80%** manual processing time
- **Improves data reliability**
- **Simplifies reporting and post-processing**

## üì• How to Use

1. Open **Power Automate Desktop**.
2. Import the **Prepayment Flow** or **Regular Flow** based on the invoice type.
3. Set the input folder containing the PDFs.
4. Run the automation.
5. Collect the generated Excel output for reporting.
